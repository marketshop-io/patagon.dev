title: A formidable Typeform alternative without the annoying paywalls.
subtitle: "upgrade to a paid plan for almost every meaningful feature ðŸ˜Ÿ."
description: "We admit Tripetto isnâ€™t as polished as Typeform yet, but it offers the same question types and much more
advanced logic. Plus, itâ€™s free. Weâ€™re working really hard to make it the best form builder you can find. <b>Why donâ€™t you
give Tripetto a try and tell us what you think?<b>"
